    <p><h1>Why did we go?</h1></p>

    <p>"Supposedly round trip plane tickets from a nearby airport are $500."</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Round trip tickets to, and from... where?</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>To Iceland, of course. But why would you go to Iceland? In addition to its desolate beauty, it is also the home of the sagas. Yes, nearly all of what we know as Norse culture comes from a windswept rock in the north Atlantic that will sell you volcano insurance for your rental rover. In Iceland, you rove 4x4 with the peace of mind that if the lava or blistering ash obliterates your car, at least you were covered. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>But the sagas didn't come out of the rock, hewn and hauled out like some precious mineral bounty of the earth. Men, following refined oral and literary traditions, wrote them. Some famous writers, like Snorri Sturlson, are known to us, others are anonymous. Sturlson died as all heroic Icelanders do: being axed to death by rivals over a petty feud but not before cranking out some classic bangers.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>But why did we go there? I think we wanted to recapture some spirit of a bygone age, to make contact physically with the salt that seasons the literary meat. To understand the authors of the sagas you need to feel the bitter wind they felt, drag your feet through the moss they must have used to ferment their shark meat, and cook in the geothermal waters of their farm. You must go to the place that produced these stories. Wait, who are we, again? My friend Vincent and I, and three of our friends.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p><h1>The Saga and the Ad</h1></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>Now here's the cool thing about Vincent: he is getting married in one month. So for his bachelor trip, we went to Iceland to soak in the saga substrates. I wanted to take Vincent's gift a little further. I commissioned a piece of art with his likeness and made it appear in the most widely circulated newspaper in Iceland, Frettabladid. I knew he would appreciate the prank but I thought I could do more. So I wrote a 6000-word saga with characters from our lives (or their namesakes), witches, magic trees, gods, feuds, and lots of other fun stuff.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I didn't plan the whole saga and then write, but wrote each part as it came to me and spent time in between parts tying them together and progressing the story. It was important that a reader of the sagas would recognize it, stylistically, as a saga. To that end, a large portion of my time was spent making sure the things people say in dialogue, the character's actions, and the humor fit the genre well. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p>I hired two editors who made great suggestions and worked on new drafts of the story at least once each day. My artists sent me their work, which "exceeded expectations." Then, it was the 22nd, one day before publication. I needed to submit the Ad copy (the actual advertisement to go in the paper). On the 23rd I went around Reykjavik asking for today's paper. I knew it was an unusual request because no one could tell me how to get it; it's usually delivered to the home. I found it in a little bodega on the main street in Reykjavik and went to meet my friends at the breakfast place we picked.</p>
    <p></p>
    <p>When my friend saw the Ad the first thing he said was that it really looked like him and that he "wanted to take a pic of this weird thing," but it took him about 5 minutes to understand that it was, in fact, him. "Wow, there's another guy with my exact name, in Iceland, who looks just like me, and is also getting married soon, what are the odds?" The odds are close to zero friends. My prank complete, I set about reflecting on the process, the reason, and the result. </p>
    <p></p>
    <p><h1>Reflections in the Waves</h1></p>
    <p></p>
    <p>The singular act of creation is man's highest purpose. It is not only your duty to realize your ideas but to make sure that you consistently bring new ideas into the world. I gave Vincent what only the kings of salt and sea could command in days of old. I gave him high skaldic honors, a personalized ode to the beauty of the sagas. I think it was worth every bead of sweat.</p>

    <p>Read the saga and tell me what you think:</p>
