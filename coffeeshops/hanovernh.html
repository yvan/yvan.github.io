    <p><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/AhcE4vpe83XHZQKL9">Still North</a> has plenty of seating, decent wifi, and pretty good coffee (they offer a tumeric latte which is always welcome). It's better than no place to work abd the wooden tables and cozy chairs are a nice plus.Though the whole town of hanover is blasted with students, and this book store is hardly an oasis. They have a pretty good selection of books though and that's nice. Make sure to pop over to the other side of the desk where they keep all the penguin classics.</p>
