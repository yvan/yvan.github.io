  <p><i><h1>Online Flight Ticketing</h1></i></p>
    
  <p>You've probably search for plane tickets online, but how do those tickets magically appear on google flights, or expedia, or kayak? I'll explain how these sites offer ticket prices, how they make money, how they get their data, and what the competitive landscape is in the industry.</p>

  <p><h2>Who is this for?</h2></p>

  <p>This is for anyone who wants to understand the airline industry, selling tickets online, and digital travel business. You might be an investor, an entrepreneur, or a curious individual who wants to understand the world around you.</p>

  <p><h2>What does the industry look like?</h2></p>

  <p>Booking holdings (<a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=BKNG">BKNG</a>) is the giant here. They own 9 other websites including priceline.com, kayak.com, rentalcars.com, opentable, and momondo. Originally BKNG started out as priceline and rode a wave of digitalization that happened in the travel industry in the early 2000s.</p>

  <p>Why does BKNG have so many separate subsidiaries? - I think it's because in the industry the name recognition of the search website is valuable. Sort like buying real estate in the mind of travelers. So when you buy a competitor there are lots of incentives to just keep the site running. It also might provide some legal separation from lawsuits (like in the case of justfly.com and how they got sued by the city of SF. It also allows the ability to operate in these other countries easier than if a foreign company came in and provides from insulation from hostile government activity. Subsidiaries can also be used as a platform to buy other compeititors in local markets easier than if a foreign competitor could.</p>

  <p></p>

  <p>Most of these websites get their data from a software called GDS.</p>
