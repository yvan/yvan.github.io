    <p><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/vaZZzYdyuBo7KJnC9">Massolit</a> is great. The wifi is decent, there's plenty of tables (though it's often crowded even during weekday afternoons). The coffee is acceptable, and they have a ton of used books you can buy and read there. The back garden is relaxing and there's enough space between tables to not be bothered by anyone smoking. There's one table inside which is actually almost optimal height for comfortable typing. There's a dope magyar language map of Afrika on the wall which gets its own little spotlight with old countries that no longer exist like Rhodesia. Yea, work here.</p>
