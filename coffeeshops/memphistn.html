    <p><a href="https://goo.gl/maps/kfYgXUHSUmxp5HEEA" target="_blank">Otherlands Coffee</a> - Just come here, parking, plugs, and wifi are all good. Ample seating and food options, as well as a work friendly environment with lots of people reading or doing work on laptops. They have weird stuff all over the coffee shop, books, free bins, and even some fish tanks. Also it's close to the university and some other stuff like overton park which is nice.</p>
    <p><a href="https://g.page/MemphisChessClub" target="_blank">Memphis Chess Club</a> - great place to work. Wifi is good, food options are good, ample comfortable seating, parking nearby. The cool thing about this place is that you can rent boardgames (5 bucks, unlimited as of 2022) and they have chess tournaments as well as a chess library you can poke around. It's right next to the abandoned and historic sterick building too.</p>
