  <p><i><b>The Relive Box</b></i></p>

  <p>tldr; I didn't like it.</p>

  <!-- gif of it burning-->
    
  <p>The book should really be titled "A Distubingly Surrealist Guide for How not to Think." I mean that on almost every level. The characters don't really think, they are placed in situations where their helplessness is on display. But instead of eliciting sympathy I can only stare down in confusion. The sitations aren't a result of bad choices the characters make, they "just happen." Many are contrived too, surreal and bizarre occurences that are disconnected from any morality, or meaningful action on the part of the character. If you start to adopt the underlying philosophy of the book, then you'll be like that too, confused and bumbling helpless through life. Do things sometimes spontaneously occur in the world? Sure. Does it ever help to be ineffective or helpess against those things? No. I think the author is trying to communicate a sense of helpessness, a feeling of being oppressed by the world dangling on scraps of hope from the precipice of reality. That said he seems very confused, because toward the end of portraying that emotion he has not connected the dots. Maybe boyle genuiely feels that this is the way of the world. You're cast on an island of reality, the waves of the storm closing in, and you simply struggling to stay afloat. There are people out there who meet such events not with the illusion of control but with a focused will and a determined solutions.</p>

  <p>When the qutoes on the book are vague, what it really tells us is that quoted people know the book is wrong subconsciously and don't really want </p>
  
  <p>The one redeeming factor that some of the stories carry with them is the concept of hope. Though in a world where helpess characters fumble from one "thing that happens to them" to the next i'm not sure it's a mercy to give them any hope. What is the hope based on? It's based on what everything else in the book is based on: nothing. The hope, like the despair, just happens --- with no connection to the behavior, the mind, or the soul of the actors in the stories.</p>

  <p>Why did I write this? Well lest you think I have some personal or specific vendetta against boyle, I do not. I have never met them, and I'm not sure there's anything they could tell me in person that they haven't already said in this book. When you deal with words, you deal with the mind of your reader. Either corrupting, confusing, or reinforcing dread, or sparking wonders, inspiring confidence, and providing inspiration. Is it sometimes useful to explore dread? Yes. Is it sometimes good to understand helplessness? Yes, by all means. But what boyle has done is create a world without cause and effect, a reality where helplessness becomes the state of being, and I don't think it's a good thing for the mind of an unsuspecting reader. Reading the work becomes a trial where keeping one's thoughts straight an unconfused is the path to acquittal. My sense is that boyle does everything in his power to find me guilty of...whatever...and condemn me to have my brain swirled. As such I can only recommend the book on the understanding that the reader knows that what they are pulling in as toxic. I can only recommend this book as a trial of your own mental fortittude.</p>
  
  <p>I'm not sure how boyle would want me to respond honestly. He never really provides an answer to any problem. "Give up" seems to be his message, even when the situations are completely avoidable with a little integrity and foresight. That's really telling, that most of the contrived and surrealist situations in the book could be avoided with some basic principles and thought. That leads me to the question: what is the philosophy of mr boyle? It's a philosophy of hopeless helplessness. It's a philosophy of giving up. It's a philosophy of death, of non existence. It's a reflection of what is wrong in our culture today, the malaise that has gripped everything from the failure to perform an orderly retreat in afghanistan, to a multi trillion dollar infrastructure bill that spends so little money on actually building infrastructure. Our culture thinks it can't do anything anymore and boyle not only reflects this, but seems to say "yes, this is natural, just the way of things, let the waves drown you now." Read the book, learn what it reflects about us, but not accept it's premises. Anyways, here I am giving free press to a death preacher.</p>
